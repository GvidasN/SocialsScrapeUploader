**Hello!**

This solution was created to help reduce manual work when uploading a video to a social media(s) (Youtube, Facebook, Instagram or TikTok). I did it just for fun to tackle my own specific use case and it seems to be working. Everything was done with the help of Selenium library.

If you wish to try and use this, some pre-configuration is required:

- Chrome Profile must be provided, as well as, the path to the Chrome User Data in the App.config.
- If you wish to have a reusable solution for constant uploading to the same Sites, fill in the Social Platforms Urls in the App.Config.


**Currently, solution is not supported! And may need fixing/updating**
